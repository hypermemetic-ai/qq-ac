name: code-review
description: Delegates review of a branch, PR, or work in progress to a fresh read-only reviewer and returns verified findings. Run automatically once for every non-trivial Change after implementation and local verification, before commit, push, pull request creation, and final GitHub-side Checks; review the exact post-review delta after in-scope fixes. Also use when the operator asks to review changes, a PR, a branch, or work since a fixed point.

# Review with fresh context

A review is independent judgment, not repeated discovery. The owning agent
resolves the orientation once and hands the reviewer a complete brief; the
reviewer grounds its verdict in the diff and the code around it. Neither
inherits the other's conclusions.

## Own the orientation

1. Define the exact change surface. Honor a supplied base; otherwise infer
   the target branch and merge-base. For work in progress, include committed,
   staged, unstaged, and untracked changes.
2. Test whether the actual Change is still the agreed Change. Reconcile the
   owning Task or specification with later approved operator decisions, then
   compare the surface against the intended outcome, the ownership boundary,
   and the explicit non-goals. If the intent sources conflict, intent stays
   unclear, or the Change crosses the boundary, stop and align first —
   delegation cannot repair a misaligned Change.
3. Compose the review brief. It is the reviewer's complete orientation, not a
   reading list:
   - repository path, base, head, and working-tree state;
   - the review objective and its layer: Task, branch, pull request, or
     working tree;
   - a changed-path map grouped by behavior, with mechanical moves, generated
     files, and historical material marked;
   - current intent, acceptance criteria, explicit inclusions, the ownership
     boundary, and the explicit non-goals;
   - the Change's threat model: what it defends and against which failure
     modes, with the finding classes explicitly declared out of scope — a
     drift-net's out-of-scope classes are owner-declined by default, not
     reported and not fixed;
   - the repository rules and standards that apply and no tool enforces;
   - the sources already consulted and the facts each one contributed;
   - relevant local Check commands with their results;
   - the reviewer's tool and permission boundary, the required finding shape
     — file, line, concrete failure path, supporting evidence — and the exact
     condition for reporting a context gap.

   Give coordinates, not dumps: repository locations rather than a pasted
   diff, distilled facts rather than source excerpts. Never include the
   author's conclusions, suspected findings, or development transcript.

   The owned reviewer rules ride the engine's injection surfaces —
   `REVIEW.md` for harness-native reviews, the review-guidelines section of
   `AGENTS.md` for codex reviewers — so the brief carries the Change-specific
   facts and does not restate them. Where the brief declares scope, the brief
   wins.

## Delegate the judgment

4. Launch one fresh read-only reviewer through Codex's non-interactive
   runner, adopting its native access control instead of any owned delegate
   machinery. Keep the brief and report under the OS temporary directory:

   ```sh
   qq-dispatch reviewer \
     --root <repository-root> \
     --brief <brief-path> \
     --output <report-path>
   ```

   The runner enforces mechanically what prose cannot: a fresh session with
   no inherited conversation, no Skills in the reviewer's context — this
   skill and its delegation step never enter it — an OS-enforced read-only
   sandbox, and the final message written to `<report-path>` by the CLI
   itself. Substitute only the bracketed paths; the rest of the prompt stays
   exactly this text — never place free text on the command line, where
   shell quoting can execute embedded text before the sandbox exists. State
   in the brief that it completes orientation: no start-of-work sequence, no
   broad searches of intent or knowledge surfaces, no full Check-suite
   reruns. Run the command as an ordinary process in the Change's work
   session, wait for it to exit, then read the report file; process exit
   retires the reviewer.

   The `timeout -k 10 3600` wrapper contains the startup wedge (doc-45): a
   `codex exec` that parks before its first byte would otherwise never exit,
   and process exit is the only signal the owning session waits on. Plain
   `timeout` signals its own process group and reaps the full codex process
   tree (probe-verified, 2026-07-16); never wrap it in `setsid`, which
   detaches the group and leaks the tree. Tune the bound to the review,
   never below real review time. Unlike wedge-hardened implementer
   dispatches, the reviewer deliberately keeps its MCP servers — the
   knowledge surfaces they provide serve review quality (operator
   disposition, 2026-07-16) — and the timeout bounds the spawn risk their
   startup adds. Exit status 124 is a reaped wedge, not a review — step 10
   applies.
5. The reviewer tests the Change's responsibilities against the brief, then
   inspects the exact diff, the surrounding callers and tests, and the
   failure paths it suspects. A correctly implemented but unapproved
   responsibility is a material intent finding. Moves and deletions are
   reviewed through their invariants, not line by line through unchanged or
   historical bodies.
6. A brief with a hole gets a context-gap report, not improvisation: the
   exact missing or contradictory fact, why the verdict depends on it, and
   the evidence already inspected. Amend the brief with exactly that fact and
   rerun step 4 fresh; without it the review cannot proceed. A context gap is
   neither a finding nor a pass.
7. Request only material findings the Change introduced, across correctness,
   security, reliability, intent, and standards no tool enforces. Treat code
   smells as maintenance heuristics, never violations: report one only when
   the diff or history shows a concrete future cost, weigh counterevidence
   such as deliberate bounded-context duplication, generated and boundary
   code, and compatibility constraints, and prescribe no refactoring from a
   label alone.

## Verify and close

8. Verify every returned finding against the Repository; a reviewer's
   conclusion is not yet evidence. A finding that claims a failure is
   confirmed only by a constructed failing scenario — a concrete input,
   state, or sequence observed to go wrong — and is discarded without one; an
   intent finding is confirmed against the agreed scope and the diff.
   Deduplicate, rank by impact, and report only confirmed findings — and say
   so plainly when none remain. When confirmed findings cluster around one
   responsibility or protocol, revisit the model with the operator instead of
   feeding a patch queue. Stop at review unless the operator asks for fixes.
9. A confirmed finding is evidence, not authorization to grow the Change. Fix
   it only when the Change introduced it, it reproduces in a supported state,
   it sits inside the agreed intent and inclusions, and the remedy is the
   smallest causal correction; otherwise report it separately and stop. After
   an in-scope fix, rerun the affected Checks and review the exact delta from
   the last reviewed tree. If a remedy would materially widen the Change,
   stop and align with the operator.

   Track the class of every confirmed finding across rounds. A new confirmed
   finding of a class already fixed in two earlier rounds trips the
   convergence circuit-breaker: sustained same-class findings measure a
   design property of the chosen layer, not implementation sloppiness, and
   every fix buys only the adjacent finding. Halt the fix loop at the last
   green state and escalate a design decision to the operator — which layer
   should own the violated invariant — instead of feeding a patch queue.
10. Handle an explicit context gap through step 6. A reviewer error, a nonzero
    exit — including 124, the timeout wrapper reaping a wedged reviewer — or a
    missing or empty report file is not a review: rerun the unchanged brief as
    a fresh step 4 invocation. Never narrow scope or soften intent to obtain a
    pass; repeated reviewer failure is a blocker.
