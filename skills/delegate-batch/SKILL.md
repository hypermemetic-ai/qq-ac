# Delegate a bounded ticket batch

Start only after intent and plan bounds settle. For aligned or board-driven
work, the accountable session stays in the project home, owning judgment and
delivery; each writing ticket gets its own worktree.

## Work orders

Write one complete brief per ticket under the OS temporary directory. Include
ticket and acceptance criteria, batch context, exact orientation paths and
verified facts, hard constraints, commit protocol, exact Checks, required
completion envelope. Writing delegates work locally, never push or open pull
requests, never edit `backlog/`. Keep durable intent in the Task, whose record
lives in its checkout. The `subagent` task is only the work-order file pointer.

- Couple shared files or invariants and work them sequentially.
- Fan out independent read-only work natively; give independent writers
  disjoint branches, worktrees, and non-Git resources.
- Run only a dependency chain's unblocked frontier. Keep at most 3–5 writing
  tickets in flight; serialize integration.

## Dispatch and status

Pi-launch env (one-time; cockpit/Herdr config/shell-rc):

Dispatch env and dispatcher config: per README Install.

Use primary-`main`; never Change copies. `cwd` selects same-Repository
worktrees.

```ts
const completionEnvelopeSchema=JSON.parse(readFileSync("<absolute-worktree>/delegation/manifests/completion-envelope.schema.json","utf8"))
subagent({agent:"implementer",task:"Read-and-perform:<absolute-brief-path>",outputSchema:completionEnvelopeSchema,acceptance:{level:"none",reason:"per the manifests"},cwd:"<absolute-worktree>",context:"fresh",async:true,timeoutMs:1800000})
```

Use only absolute paths: the task points to the work order, `cwd` to its
worktree. Pi-subagents owns role configuration, lifecycle, and artifacts; the
adapter owns containment. Opt into external knowledge only when the brief
requires it; harness-native subagents only for tools or judgment beyond the
plan bound.

Keep returned id/`details.asyncDir`. Inspect once at natural boundaries, never
poll: id/fleet status, `status.json`, `events.jsonl`, live
`output-<index>.log`, `subagent-log-<run-id>.md`. No start after ten minutes
blocks with `no thread after 10m`. Terminal nonzero or missing/invalid
structured output fails dispatch. Resume intact children after infrastructure
failure with `timeoutMs:1800000` and no contract override. Reconstruct
dispatcher loss from Tasks, native artifacts, transcripts, worktrees.

Confined child suite runs are best-effort: Landlock cannot pass
`/dev/fd` process substitution; report those as `inconclusive-under-substrate`.
The owner's native rerun plus CI is binding green.

## Verify and close

The envelope reports per-ticket status, commits, files, Check results,
contestable decisions, open questions, risks, branch, worktree — plus parallel,
never-blended net production-LOC and decision-point deltas per fix commit.
Verify every claim against the tree before publishing `envelope-verified`.

Growth in either counter spends one mechanical `same fix, smaller`
regeneration: checks pass and strictly smaller takes it; otherwise the original
stands.

The owner may steer rework but never transfers lifecycle, alignment, review, or
delivery. New decisions and scope gaps return to the assigner. Retain the five
gates—intent alignment, plan approval, review verdict, acceptance, merge—and
route every Change through `code-review` and `deliver-change`.
