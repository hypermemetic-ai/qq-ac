name: orchestrate
description: Conducts a non-trivial engineering task through qq-ac's full loop as a two-model split — Claude conducts and judges in the main session while Codex does the implementation — so interactive work and noisy reads never pollute the conductor's context and the reviewer is never the author. Use to take a real build task from intent to a landed, verified change end-to-end; not for questions, lookups, or trivial one-liners, which take the escape hatch.

# Orchestrate

Conduct; don't play every instrument. You hold the baton in the main session —
intent, judgment, the human gates — and route the work that would otherwise bury
this context to where it belongs: implementation to **Codex**, noisy reads to
**Claude sub-agents** that hand back only their artifact. The separation is the
point, not a cost: Claude never writes the code it later verifies and reviews, so
the verdict is worth something.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the orchestrate skill to run this through the loop."

## Who does what

- **Claude, main session (you)** — triage, Align, approve the plan, consent gates,
  UAT sign-off, the final report. Everything interactive or judgment-bearing.
- **Claude sub-agents** — plan drafting, verification, code-review, compounding.
  Each returns only its artifact; the reads that produced it stay out of this context.
- **Codex** (`codex exec`) — implementation and its own repair. Nothing else. Model,
  reasoning effort, sandbox, and approvals come from `~/.codex/config.toml`
  (`gpt-5.5` / `xhigh` / full-access / no-prompt here); pass `-c` overrides only if
  you must.

Two rules make the separation real:

- **Once a task enters the loop, you never implement — Codex does.** Not "to save a
  round-trip," not "it's a one-liner inside a bigger task." The moment Claude writes
  shipped code, the later review and verification are grading their own author. The
  only code you write yourself is triage's escape hatch (step 0), which never enters
  the loop.
- **`verification-before-completion` is never skipped** — on the conducted path or
  the escape hatch. This is the AGENTS.md invariant; it holds here too.

## The run

### 0 — Triage first
Trivial + local + reversible (typo, rename, one-liner)? Do it here, run
`verification-before-completion`, commit on green (land per the project's Git mode —
AGENTS.md § Git), stop. No Codex, no phases — the command must not turn a rename into
a ceremony. Everything else conducts the loop below.

### 1 — Align (main)
`grilling` / `grill-me` with the owner: pin intent and resolve the open decision
branches. Dispatch nothing until intent is settled.

### 2 — Plan (sub-agent drafts → you approve)
Dispatch a Claude sub-agent to draft the plan via `writing-plans`; it returns the
plan doc, not the reading behind it. Review it in the main session with the owner
and approve or edit. The approved plan is Codex's brief.

### 3 — Build (Codex implements)
Hand work to Codex **adaptively**: batch independent, low-risk tasks into one
handoff; isolate risky or coupled ones. Handoffs are sequential — Codex holds the
working tree, you wait, then verify; don't edit the tree while Codex has it.

- First handoff: `codex exec "<plan task(s) + the acceptance check>"` from the repo
  root. Codex edits the working tree in place (this repo is trusted + full-access)
  and inherits `AGENTS.md` as its own instructions, so the behavioral floor already
  binds it — point it at the plan task, don't re-explain the standards.
- Later handoffs: `codex exec resume --last "<next task(s)>"` so its context stays
  warm across the plan.

### 4 — Verify (sub-agent)
After each handoff, dispatch a Claude sub-agent to run `verification-before-completion`
against the real commands; it returns the evidence bundle (command + full output),
not the churn.

- **Green** → commit the verified work and land it per the project's Git mode
  (AGENTS.md § Git); then the next handoff, or step 5 once the plan is done.
- **Red** → hand the failing evidence back to Codex (`codex exec resume --last`) to
  fix, then re-verify. After **2** failed Codex rounds on the same failure, stop and
  bring it to the owner in the main session — don't grind.

### 5 — Sign-off (main, gated)
User-facing, irreversible, or ambiguous change? → `uat-signoff` with the owner,
seeded by step 4's evidence. Otherwise skip.

### 6 — Review (sub-agents)
Dispatch `code-review` (Standards + Spec) as sub-agents; they return the two reports.
Codex wrote the code and Claude reviews it, so this is a genuine second pair of eyes.
Weigh the feedback with `receiving-code-review` — don't rubber-stamp it.

### 7 — Compound (sub-agent)
Solved something worth not relearning? → dispatch `ce-compound` to capture it to
`docs/solutions/` + `CONCEPTS.md`. Returns the files for a glance.

## Done means
Report to the owner only when the plan's tasks are implemented by Codex,
verification is green with evidence, any required sign-off is granted, review is
in hand, and the work is landed per the project's Git mode. Name what Codex built,
paste the verifying evidence, link the review. A
"done" without the green evidence bundle is not done.

## When NOT to use
- A trivial, local, reversible change — that's the escape hatch in step 0, not a
  reason to spin up the loop.
- A question, a lookup, a read — answer it; orchestration is for landing a change.
- A pure investigation with no build — use `research`.
- Work already mid-loop — resume the phase you're in; don't restart the conductor.

## Integration
Conducts these skills, each in its designed locus: `grilling`, `writing-plans`,
`verification-before-completion`, `uat-signoff`, `code-review`,
`receiving-code-review`, `ce-compound`. Implementation is delegated to Codex
(`codex exec`), never run here. `AGENTS.md` holds the phase definitions and the
routing this skill obeys — it is the source of truth; this skill is its invocable form.
