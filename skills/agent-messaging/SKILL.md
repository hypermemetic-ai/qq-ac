# Message agents through herdr

herdr names every agent session and exposes it to the others. `herdr agent
list` shows who is live, `herdr agent get <name>` inspects one, `herdr agent
read <name>` reads its pane, and `herdr agent wait <name>` blocks until it
finishes.

Message text is literal: escape sequences such as `\n` render as characters,
not formatting, so send prompts as clean single-line text. Use `herdr agent
send <target> "<message>"` only when the text should remain unsubmitted. To send
a prompt as a turn, use `herdr pane run <pane-id> "<message>"`; it sends the
text and Enter in one request. Do not compose a turn from separate send and key
calls.

Identify every inter-agent turn as `AGENT from=<terminal-id>: <message>`. Read
the sender's current `terminal_id` from `herdr pane current --current`; do not
use inherited `HERDR_PANE_ID` or `HERDR_WORKSPACE_ID` values because they can be
stale after pane movement.

On receipt, verify the source with `herdr agent get <terminal-id>`. When a reply
is needed, resolve its current `.result.agent.pane_id`, then send the reply with
`herdr pane run` and the same envelope containing your own current terminal ID.
Never leave an inter-agent reply only in the receiving agent's transcript. If
the source no longer resolves, report that the reply is unrouteable instead of
guessing a destination.

The agent that starts a temporary delegate owns its pane. Retain it through the
final result and any required follow-up; then close it with `herdr pane close
<pane-id>` and verify it no longer resolves. Report cleanup failure; never close
the accountable or an operator-created pane.

No correlation IDs or acknowledgement protocol exists. Coordinate when it
helps; skip the ceremony when it does not.
