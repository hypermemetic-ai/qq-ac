# qq

qq is qqp-dev's operator-owned harness for agentic development. This repository
is the source of its shared methodology, skills, project knowledge, and cockpit
preferences.

## Model

qq uses seven descriptive entities:

| entity | owner or surface |
|---|---|
| **Actor** | the operator and replaceable agents |
| **Repository** | Git and GitHub |
| **Task** | Backlog.md |
| **Change** | branch, commits, and pull request |
| **Check** | local verification and GitHub Actions |
| **Skill** | `skills/` |
| **Knowledge item** | `CONCEPTS.md`, Backlog documents and decisions, OpenWiki, and codebase-memory |

Every retained component supports one of these entities or provides the minimum
wiring needed to expose it.

## Repository surfaces

- [`AGENTS.md`](./AGENTS.md) is the shared operating guidance. Linked
  Repositories can inherit the same file through a root-level symlink.
- `skills/` contains stateless capabilities discovered through each agent
  runtime's native skill surface.
- `backlog/` holds Tasks, authored documents, and decisions managed through the
  Backlog CLI and its shared search index.
- `CONCEPTS.md` is the shared language agents read before every work item.
- The single `Ideas` Backlog document is the idea capture surface.
- Backlog document categories `plans`, `research`, and `solutions` retain
  historical designs, cited investigations, and reusable lessons.
- herdr provides persistent `main` project homes, short-labeled grouped
  worktree sessions, named agents, and direct agent-to-agent messaging.
- `cockpit/` contains the operator's terminal configuration.
- `bin/` installs the live qq surfaces, runs guarded local OpenWiki updates, and
  validates Herdr project-home focus and pane movement.

## Delivery

GitHub Flow is the delivery path. The `deliver-change` Skill owns the agent
procedure for carrying an authorized Change to a green pull request; the
operator merges.

## Install qq

From the qq Repository root, run:

```bash
bash bin/install.sh
```

The installer live-links Skills into Codex, links the cockpit configuration and
retained commands, and installs the locked dependencies for qq's BPMN
publisher. It prunes links to qq Skills and commands that no longer exist and
refuses to replace paths it does not manage. Run it again after adding or
removing a Skill.

The installer does not manage repository instructions. A linked Repository can
point its root `AGENTS.md` symlink directly to qq's `AGENTS.md`, keeping one
source of truth without adding global guidance to unrelated Repositories.

## Knowledge runtime

OpenWiki and codebase-memory are upstream tools, not vendored qq subsystems.
Install and update them through their own package mechanisms.

OpenWiki uses local ChatGPT OAuth and writes the Repository's current-system
documentation under `openwiki/`:

```bash
qq-openwiki --init
qq-openwiki --update
```

During that same OpenWiki model run, the internal generator decides which
source-backed processes materially benefit from BPMN; there is no diagram
quota. For each useful process it authors a JSON model under
`openwiki/processes/`, invokes qq's guarded deterministic publisher, and embeds
the generated PNG in the relevant narrative page.
`qq-openwiki-bpmn --check openwiki/processes/<id>.json` independently verifies
a retained model and its published semantic BPMN and PNG.

In a restricted fresh-agent or service environment, set `OPENWIKI_BIN` to the
OpenWiki executable's absolute path. The wrapper validates and invokes that
path directly; when it is unset, the wrapper falls back to `command -v
openwiki`. It does not use a login shell for executable discovery. When Node is
also absent from `PATH` and is not beside that OpenWiki executable, set
`QQ_OPENWIKI_NODE_BIN` to Node's absolute path; the wrapper carries the
validated runtime into OpenWiki's diagram-publishing commands.

Temporary debt (2026-07-10): ChatGPT OAuth merged in OpenWiki PR #151 after the
0.1.0 npm release. The operator machine is therefore built from upstream commit
`90e8b22f562a5c8cf3c7377e081710084db1689f`. Replace that source build with
`npm install -g openwiki@latest` and remove this note as soon as a published
release contains PR #151; installing 0.1.0 from npm before then removes OAuth
support.

Its credentials stay under `~/.openwiki/`, uncommitted.

OpenWiki is a local single-writer derived surface owned by a separate maintainer
Actor, not by source-change agents. An advance of `main` is the maintainer's
input. The `openwiki-maintainer` Skill owns observation, activation, independent
verification, and delivery from its dedicated worktree; OpenWiki's internal
generator owns narrative and diagram authorship. `qq-openwiki` supplies the
diagram-authoring instruction plus deterministic branch, freshness,
process-lock, and root-instruction restoration guards.

### Merge-triggered maintenance

The operator merges Changes from GitHub in Zen. Install Tampermonkey once, then
install qq's generic [OpenWiki merge userscript](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hypermemetic-ai/qq/main/browser/openwiki-merge-activator.user.js).
Run `bash bin/install.sh` to register the local `qq-openwiki://` protocol handler;
Zen may ask once for permission to open that local application.

On any GitHub pull-request page, the userscript reacts only to the final merge
confirmation and sends the canonical PR URL to the local handler. The handler
finds the matching checkout beneath `QQ_PROJECT_ROOTS` (a colon-separated list,
defaulting to `~/projects`), matches its GitHub origin, and requires its root
`AGENTS.md` symlink to resolve to qq's canonical `AGENTS.md`. It then independently
uses the authenticated `gh` session to require a completed merge into `main` by
that operator. It ignores `openwiki/update` merges, records each dispatched merge
commit once per Repository under the user's state directory, and launches or
wakes that Repository's dedicated maintainer Codex session in the worktree's
root pane through Herdr.

This activation path has no polling, daemon, local server, Repository registry,
custom browser extension, or self-hosted runner. Each linked Repository needs its
own long-lived `openwiki/update` worktree before activation.

Temporary debt (2026-07-10): upstream code mode unconditionally writes a
scheduled GitHub Actions workflow and scheduled-workflow agent guidance.
`qq-openwiki` removes that generated workflow and restores the pre-run root
instruction state after every local run. Remove this compatibility behavior
when OpenWiki supports local-only code recurrence without managing agent files.

codebase-memory 0.9 or later maintains its derived graph outside the Repository.
Enable initial indexing and background Git change detection:

```bash
codebase-memory-mcp update
codebase-memory-mcp config set auto_index true
codebase-memory-mcp config set auto_watch true
```

After restarting the agent runtime, index each long-lived Repository root once.
codebase-memory's stock agent adapter owns usage guidance, while its configured
indexer and watcher own freshness. `openwiki/operations.md` describes the
running stack.
