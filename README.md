# qq

qq is qqp-dev's operator-owned harness for agentic development. This repository
is the source of its shared methodology, skills, project knowledge, and cockpit
preferences.

## Model

qq uses seven descriptive entities:

| entity | owner or surface |
|---|---|
| **Actor** | the operator and replaceable agents |
| **Repository** | Git and GitHub |
| **Task** | Backlog.md |
| **Change** | branch, commits, and pull request |
| **Check** | local verification and GitHub Actions |
| **Skill** | `skills/` |
| **Knowledge item** | `CONCEPTS.md`, Backlog documents and decisions, OpenWiki, and codebase-memory |

Every retained component supports one of these entities or provides the minimum
wiring needed to expose it.

## Repository surfaces

- [`AGENTS.md`](./AGENTS.md) is the shared operating guidance. Linked
  Repositories can inherit the same file through a root-level symlink.
- `skills/` contains stateless capabilities discovered through each agent
  runtime's native skill surface.
- `backlog/` holds Tasks, authored documents, and decisions managed through the
  Backlog CLI and its shared search index.
- `CONCEPTS.md` is the shared language agents read before every work item.
- The single `Ideas` Backlog document is the idea capture surface.
- Backlog document categories `plans`, `research`, and `solutions` retain
  historical designs, cited investigations, and reusable lessons.
- herdr provides persistent `main` project homes, short-labeled grouped
  worktree sessions, named agents, and direct agent-to-agent messaging.
- `cockpit/` contains the operator's terminal configuration.
- `bin/` holds the qq commands — mounted on `PATH` by the cockpit shell
  surface — for guarded local OpenWiki updates and Herdr project-home focus
  and pane movement.

## Delivery

GitHub Flow is the delivery path. The `deliver-change` Skill owns the agent
procedure for carrying an authorized Change to a green pull request; the
operator merges.

## Install qq

Installation is by construction: every runtime surface mounts this checkout
directly, so day-to-day changes — adding, editing, or removing a Skill or a
command — are live everywhere with no install step. A machine is bootstrapped
once.

Mount the Skill set for Claude Code and Codex:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude ~/.codex
ln -sT "$HOME/projects/qq/skills" "$HOME/.claude/skills"
ln -sT "$HOME/projects/qq/skills" "$HOME/.codex/skills"
```

Mount qq's Codex execution profiles into Codex's fixed profile directory:

```bash
ln -s "$HOME/projects/qq/codex-profiles/qq-implementer.config.toml" "$HOME/.codex/qq-implementer.config.toml"
ln -s "$HOME/projects/qq/codex-profiles/qq-reviewer.config.toml" "$HOME/.codex/qq-reviewer.config.toml"
ln -s "$HOME/projects/qq/codex-profiles/qq-researcher.config.toml" "$HOME/.codex/qq-researcher.config.toml"
```

`qq-dispatch` requires these links to resolve back to the checkout, so profile
changes stay live without a copy step. The profiles carry sandbox and Skill
settings; implementer dispatch adds the MCP-off override, while reviewer and
researcher dispatches retain the user's configured MCP servers.

On a machine migrating off the retired installer, remove the old per-skill
link directories first (after checking they hold nothing but links into this
checkout): `rm -r ~/.claude/skills ~/.codex/skills`. `ln -sT` fails loudly
rather than nesting a link inside a directory that still exists.

Source the shell surface from `.bashrc`; it prepends `bin/` to `PATH` and
provides the cockpit navigation helpers:

```bash
. "$HOME/projects/qq/cockpit/shell/file-navigation.bash"
```

Link the cockpit configurations whose tools read fixed `~/.config` paths:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/yazi/plugins/smart-enter.yazi ~/.config/glow ~/.config/herdr
ln -s "$HOME/projects/qq/cockpit/yazi/yazi.toml" ~/.config/yazi/yazi.toml
ln -s "$HOME/projects/qq/cockpit/yazi/keymap.toml" ~/.config/yazi/keymap.toml
ln -s "$HOME/projects/qq/cockpit/yazi/plugins/smart-enter.yazi/main.lua" ~/.config/yazi/plugins/smart-enter.yazi/main.lua
ln -s "$HOME/projects/qq/cockpit/glow/glow.yml" ~/.config/glow/glow.yml
ln -s "$HOME/projects/qq/cockpit/glow/tuned.json" ~/.config/glow/tuned.json
ln -s "$HOME/projects/qq/cockpit/herdr/config.toml" ~/.config/herdr/config.toml
```

These file links are day-0 bootstrap, not a sync surface: content is live
through each link, and the set changes only when a new cockpit tool is
adopted. Nothing needs re-running when Skills or commands change.

Bootstrap does not manage repository instructions. A linked Repository can
point its root `AGENTS.md` symlink directly to qq's `AGENTS.md`, keeping one
source of truth without adding global guidance to unrelated Repositories.

## Knowledge runtime

OpenWiki and codebase-memory are upstream tools, not vendored qq subsystems.
Install and update them through their own package mechanisms.

OpenWiki uses local ChatGPT OAuth and writes the Repository's current-system
documentation under `openwiki/`:

```bash
qq-openwiki --init
qq-openwiki --update
```

In a restricted fresh-agent or service environment, set `QQ_OPENWIKI_BIN` to the
OpenWiki executable's absolute path. The wrapper validates and invokes that
path directly; when it is unset, the shared resolver checks `PATH` and known
Homebrew locations. It does not use a login shell for executable discovery.
The same `QQ_<TOOL>_BIN` convention applies to Herdr, GitHub CLI, Git, and Codex
where qq resolves those tools.

Temporary debt (2026-07-10): ChatGPT OAuth merged in OpenWiki PR #151 after the
0.1.0 npm release. The operator machine is therefore built from upstream commit
`90e8b22f562a5c8cf3c7377e081710084db1689f`. Replace that source build with
`npm install -g openwiki@latest` and remove this note as soon as a published
release contains PR #151; installing 0.1.0 from npm before then removes OAuth
support.

Its credentials stay under `~/.openwiki/`, uncommitted.

OpenWiki is a local single-writer derived surface owned by a separate maintainer
Actor, not by source-change agents. Refresh is explicitly assigned on demand or
by an optional schedule; source Changes do not trigger or perform it. The
`openwiki-maintainer` Skill owns generation, independent verification, and
delivery from its dedicated worktree; OpenWiki's internal generator owns
wiki authorship. `qq-openwiki` supplies deterministic branch, freshness,
process-lock, and root-instruction restoration guards.

### On-demand or scheduled maintenance

Keep one long-lived `openwiki/update` worktree per linked Repository. For an
assigned refresh, fetch `origin`, reset that worktree to the fresh `origin/main`,
and run `qq-openwiki --update` (`--init` only for first setup). Review the
complete generated diff through `code-review`, and open an ordinary
documentation-only pull request. The operator reviews and merges it.

Temporary debt (2026-07-10): upstream code mode unconditionally writes a
scheduled GitHub Actions workflow and scheduled-workflow agent guidance.
`qq-openwiki` removes that generated workflow and restores the pre-run root
instruction state after every local run. Remove this compatibility behavior
when OpenWiki supports local-only code recurrence without managing agent files.

codebase-memory 0.9 or later maintains its derived graph outside the Repository.
Enable initial indexing and background Git change detection:

```bash
codebase-memory-mcp update
codebase-memory-mcp config set auto_index true
codebase-memory-mcp config set auto_watch true
```

After restarting the agent runtime, index each long-lived Repository root once.
codebase-memory's stock agent adapter owns usage guidance, while its configured
indexer and watcher own freshness. `openwiki/operations.md` describes the
running stack.
