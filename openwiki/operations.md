# Operations

## Install the live surfaces

From the Repository root:

```bash
bash bin/install.sh
```

The installer resolves the checkout from its own location, installs the locked BPMN pipeline dependencies, and live-links:

- each `skills/*` directory containing `SKILL.md` to `~/.codex/skills/`;
- yazi, Glow, Herdr, and shell cockpit files to `~/.config/`;
- `qq-herdr-pull`, `qq-openwiki`, `qq-openwiki-bpmn`, and `qq-openwiki-activate` to `~/.local/bin/`;
- the OpenWiki merge userscript into the qq data directory.

It also installs a managed desktop entry and registers `qq-openwiki://` as a local protocol handler. The installer prunes dead links into this checkout and refuses to replace unmanaged paths or desktop entries (`bin/install.sh:43-65`, `85-150`). It does not manage repository instruction files; linked Repositories point their own root `AGENTS.md` symlink to qq's canonical `AGENTS.md`.

## Cockpit

`cockpit/` is the source of truth for the operator terminal surface:

- yazi provides pane-first file navigation and Markdown opening;
- Glow/mdcat render Markdown in-pane;
- broot provides a tree view;
- shell helpers define `QQ_HOME`, generic navigation wrappers, and qq-focused commands;
- herdr supplies the themed, priority-sorted agent surface and pane bindings.

Typical flow: `prefix+f` launches `qqy` at the Repository root, `prefix+shift+f` launches `qqbr`, `prefix+F<N>` pulls the Nth agent into focus, and `prefix+0` pulls the agent most needing attention. See [`cockpit/README.md`](../cockpit/README.md).

## Herdr pane pulling

`qq-herdr-pull <N|next>` identifies the focused pane, selects an agent from `herdr agent list`, moves that pane into the focused tab, and closes the old pane only after a successful move. Numeric selection is 1-based. `next` prioritizes blocked, then working, then idle agents while excluding the current pane.

The command requires `jq` and resolves Herdr from `HERDR_BIN_PATH`, `PATH`, or a known Homebrew path. Operator mode runs detached, so errors are best-effort notifications and exit successfully. Use a dry run before testing layout mutation:

```bash
QQ_HERDR_PULL_DRY=1 HERDR_PANE_ID=<pane-id> qq-herdr-pull next
```

`qq-herdr-pull --workspace <workspace-id>` is the fail-fast agent mode used by `deliver-change`. It resolves the caller's live pane identity, safely no-ops if already present, otherwise accepts only the target workspace's sole idle non-agent shell, moves the accountable agent, confirms Herdr reported a changed move, and only then closes the placeholder (`bin/qq-herdr-pull:69-112`, `175-205`). Stop before Repository mutation if adoption fails.

## Merge-triggered OpenWiki maintenance

Install the Tampermonkey userscript linked from the README and create one long-lived `openwiki/update` worktree per linked Repository. On the final GitHub merge confirmation, the userscript waits briefly, then sends the canonical PR URL to the local protocol handler (`browser/openwiki-merge-activator.user.js:16-50`).

`qq-openwiki-activate` finds an unambiguous checkout under `QQ_PROJECT_ROOTS`, requires its root `AGENTS.md` to resolve to qq's canonical instructions, and polls GitHub for a completed merge. It dispatches only operator-authored merges into `main`, ignores `openwiki/update` merges, and records each merge SHA before launching or waking the named maintainer session. This marker makes dispatch at-most-once: an uncertain Herdr failure is not automatically retried (`bin/qq-openwiki-activate:174-228`, `324-427`).

## Knowledge maintenance

OpenWiki and codebase-memory are installed separately. `bash bin/install.sh` links qq's guarded wrappers into `~/.local/bin`; the README describes the upstream runtime setup. `qq-openwiki --update` requires the dedicated branch to be clean and exactly equal to `origin/main`, then holds a per-Repository writer lock and restores root instruction files after generation. `--correct` instead requires a fully staged baseline confined to `openwiki/` (`bin/qq-openwiki:76-129`, `162-215`).

The generator may add evidence-backed process specs under `openwiki/processes/`. `qq-openwiki-bpmn` publishes only the semantic BPMN and attributed PNG after path/evidence validation, lint/layout, evidence round-trip, and deterministic repeat generation; `--check` verifies retained artifacts without replacing them. Ordinary source agents only consume the wiki, and the `openwiki-maintainer` Skill is the sole maintenance procedure.

For codebase-memory 0.9+:

```bash
codebase-memory-mcp update
codebase-memory-mcp config set auto_index true
codebase-memory-mcp config set auto_watch true
```

Confirm graph readiness with its project/status tools and reindex after material branch or uncommitted changes. `detect_changes` analyzes impact; it does not prove freshness.

## Local documentation ownership

Ordinary source agents neither assess nor generate OpenWiki changes. The
narrowly triggered `openwiki-maintainer` Skill is the sole procedural authority.
