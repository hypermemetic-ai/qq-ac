## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Add §Parallel operation to qq-methodology.md: tree-ownership protocol (one writer per working tree; main tree belongs to the operator's interactive session; background producers in a tree they don't own are read-only + stamp their own qq-phase producer slot), shared-surface conventions (CONCEPTS.md appends, docs/solutions/ pruning, ideas/NN- and research/ numbering — write on own branch, land via merge; claim sequence numbers by filename creation), global-config rule (skills/ and cockpit/ edits happen in a worktree and land via the gate — the main checkout is live-linked into every session). PLUS parallel dispatch (operator ask, 2026-07-08): make flagging parallelizable work a standing part of triage — every task gets a parallel-ok label or a blocked-by note at creation/triage time; when the operator asks for 'next task' with a deep queue, the agent proposes a wave (independent parallel-ok tasks fanned out via herdr worktrees, one agent per task, each claiming its task in the registry) instead of defaulting to serial. Thread the one-line rules into the affected skills.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Frontier definition, claim-by-assignment, and hitl/afk labels documented in §Parallel operation
- [ ] #2 bin/qq-frontier lists exactly the claimable tasks (status To Do, deps Done, unassigned)
- [ ] #3 Triage/routing text tells agents to flag parallelizable work (label + blocked-by) and to propose herdr fan-out waves unprompted when the queue is deep
