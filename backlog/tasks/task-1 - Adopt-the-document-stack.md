## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Retire Understand-Anything (untrack .understand-anything/, drop plugin refs), rewrite methodology to the settled stack (codebase-memory MCP / backlog / openwiki / compound) and the single all-gated landing path, wire gate checks (registry check on test, openwiki refresh on format), seed this registry. Lands as feat/document-stack.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 No tracked .understand-anything/ and no plugin references in README/methodology/install
- [ ] #2 Gate refuses a landing that does not touch backlog/ (once config is on main)
- [ ] #3 Methodology documents the four-document stack and the herdr agent-comms primitives
