## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Reported from the meeting-reviewer session, 2026-07-09, and verified against main: bin/qq-frontier sorts by (priority rank, ordinal), so equal-priority tasks break ties on ordinal and there is no way to say 'this task is the head of the queue' except by hand-tuning ordinals. The reporter's registry prose said TASK-12 lands first while 'qq-frontier --json' listed TASK-6 first, because both are priority:high and 6000 < 12000. Note how it surfaced: the gate caught the contradiction by RUNNING the tool; the author had only read it. Decide whether the registry should express queue order directly, or whether ordinal-as-order is the contract and the conductor must stop writing prose that contradicts it.
