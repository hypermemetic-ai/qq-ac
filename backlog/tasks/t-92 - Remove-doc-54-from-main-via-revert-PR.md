## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
The operator has ended the Factory.ai/droid exploration and wants no retained artifacts in the Repository. doc-54 landed on main via PR #146 earlier tonight; remove it from main's tree with an ordinary new commit through GitHub Flow.

Decision ledger:
- Remove doc-54 from main's tree via new commit + PR (no history rewrite): operator's explicit verbatim instruction in the accountable pi session 2026-07-19 — "don't need to delete, just undo with new commit + PR", superseding nothing and following "I said no trace. kill everything." (asked-and-answered alignment exchange).
- Leave git history, the PR #146 record, and its diff untouched (no force-push, no GitHub Support purge): same exchange, operator declined the history-rewrite option after the ruleset rejected it.

<!-- AC:END -->

## Final Summary
