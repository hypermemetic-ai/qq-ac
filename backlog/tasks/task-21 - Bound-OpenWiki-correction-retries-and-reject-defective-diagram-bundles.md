## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Operator finding from the first live BPMN-bearing OpenWiki refresh: a complete generation produced independently verified narrative pages plus optional diagrams with material semantic edge errors. The maintainer contract converted those local diagram failures into an unbounded whole-wiki discard/regenerate loop, while subjective panoramic guidance also encouraged cosmetic rejection. Preserve internal-generator semantic authorship and the single-writer/main-supersede design, but make verification failures proportional and bounded.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 A materially defective optional diagram is rejected as one complete JSON/BPMN/PNG/Markdown-link bundle without discarding independently verified narrative output; the outer maintainer never rewrites diagram semantics.
- [ ] #2 For one landed origin/main SHA, a complete generated result receives at most one evidence-backed whole-generation correction retry; if the corrected result remains materially invalid, the maintainer preserves the evidence, does not commit or push, and stops for operator direction.
- [ ] #3 Incomplete or failed generation and a newer landed main still reset and regenerate from current origin/main, preserving the single-writer and supersede-in-place decisions.
- [ ] #4 Diagram acceptance is based on material semantic correctness, source evidence, and actual readability at the embed plus linked full resolution; aspect ratio alone is not a rejection condition.
- [ ] #5 Focused wrapper and methodology Checks plus fresh-context code review pass before the Change is committed or published.
<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation Plan

<!-- SECTION:PLAN:BEGIN -->
1. Rewrite openwiki-maintainer verification recovery so defective optional diagrams are mechanically rejected as a complete bundle, non-diagram correction reruns are capped at one per target SHA, repeated failures preserve evidence and stop, and newer-main/incomplete-run reset semantics remain bounded and intact. 2. Tighten qq-openwiki's internal-generator guidance around semantic edge tracing, embed-plus-full-resolution readability, aspect-ratio neutrality, standalone image links, and narrative independence. 3. Update focused wrapper assertions and run wrapper, syntax, lint, Skill-validation, BPMN, and diff Checks. 4. Run fresh-context review, correct only confirmed in-scope findings, and review the exact delta. 5. Commit, push, open one PR, pass final Checks, record strict plan conformance and Task finalization, and hand off the green Change.

## Implementation Notes

<!-- SECTION:NOTES:BEGIN -->
The live maintainer's final corrected result was preserved without delivery after two confirmed P1 defects. That observed state exercises the new precedence: because a narrative defect remained after the allowed correction, the complete result—including its bad diagram—must stay intact as evidence rather than being reset, rerun, or partially deleted.

A fresh-context read-only forward test of the revised Skill covered three realistic states with no supplied expected answer: diagram-only failure, a corrected result with mixed narrative and diagram defects, and two consecutive upstream failures. It deterministically selected bundle rejection and continued verification for the first, complete evidence preservation and operator stop for the second, and clean stop without a third generator call for the third; it reported no ambiguity.

Fresh-context review found two confirmed issues: optional bundle deletion preceded later scope/documentation/review checks and could destroy mixed-defect evidence; and the plan's principal policy node cited a stale Skill range. The recovery workflow now completes all local verification and fresh review on the intact generated set before any bundle deletion, then reviews only the exact removal delta. The plan node now cites TASK-21 acceptance criteria directly and the semantic BPMN was regenerated.

Exact-delta review found that bundle deletion was still irreversible if its own checks failed on an already-corrected result. Bundle rejection is now transactional: after full-set verification, the maintainer stages the intact scope-checked generated result as a non-deliverable index snapshot, reviews the unstaged removal against it, replaces the snapshot only after green checks/review, and otherwise restores and unstages the complete evidence before entering the bounded correction/stop branch.

A focused forward test of the removal-failure branch restored the worktree from the staged snapshot before unstaging, preserved the complete corrected result and review evidence, prohibited reset/rerun/commit/push, and reported no ambiguity. The same fresh-context reviewer then inspected the exact transactional correction and returned no material findings: the staged index preserves new and modified bundle files plus the Markdown link, git diff -- exposes the removal, and the required restore order reaches the stop branch with intact uncommitted evidence.

Operator approved the rendered doc-30 BPMN plan on 2026-07-13. Implementation may proceed within its preserved-authorship and single-writer boundary.

Explicit non-goals from alignment: do not change the platform-level progress-update cadence, OpenWiki provider/model, BPMN schema/layout/publisher, activation, single-writer locking, internal-generator semantic authorship, or supersede-on-new-main behavior.
