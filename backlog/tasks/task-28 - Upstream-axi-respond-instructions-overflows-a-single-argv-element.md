## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Reported from the meeting-reviewer session, 2026-07-09: 'no-mistakes axi respond --action fix --instructions <~4.5KB>' died with 'step review failed: agent fix: claude start: fork/exec /home/qqp/.local/bin/claude: argument list too long', killing run 01KX2H1KSW8PSNQZ3G5FP6GGC7 outright and forcing hand-applied fixes plus a fresh run. CORRECTED CAUSE: 4.5KB is not the limit and cannot itself be E2BIG. Reproduced locally: ARG_MAX is 4194304, but the per-argument cap MAX_ARG_STRLEN is exactly 131072 bytes (32 * 4096 page size); execing /bin/true with a 131071-byte argv element succeeds and 131072 fails. So no-mistakes must be composing --instructions INTO a single prompt argument alongside the diff and findings, and that composite crossed 128 KiB. A fix framed as 'cap the instructions length' would treat the symptom; the bug is unbounded composition into one argv element. Upstream fix: pass the composed prompt on stdin or via a temp file. qq-side: the landing agent already routes long instructions through a file, but still expands it with $(cat file) into argv -- same hazard, one composition step later.
