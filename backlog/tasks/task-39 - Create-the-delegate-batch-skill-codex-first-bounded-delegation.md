## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Per doc-42: a stateless skill owning batch delegation on the engine/glass architecture. It composes work-order briefs from aligned Tasks; selects the runtime codex-first (codex exec, workspace-write sandbox, dedicated worktree per writing ticket; a Claude subagent only when the work needs harness-native tools or judgment beyond plan bounds); requires a completion envelope (changed files, Checks run with results, unresolved risks, branch and worktree); bounds writing-ticket concurrency at 3–5; selects sequential vs fanout per doc-41's work-shape table; and covers both entry points (aligned new-work batch; board-driven dispatch) plus the dispatcher posture (the accountable session stays in the project home — an explicit exception to deliver-change step 1).

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 skills/delegate-batch/SKILL.md exists in house trigger-sentence style and covers work-order brief composition, codex-first runtime selection, the completion envelope, one worktree per writing ticket, the 3–5 concurrency bound, sequential-vs-fanout selection, both entry points, and the dispatcher posture
- [ ] #2 bin/install.sh links the skill for both runtimes and prunes it cleanly on removal
- [ ] #3 A real ticket batch executes end-to-end through a codex delegate under the skill and returns a conforming completion envelope; the live Check is recorded in task notes
- [ ] #4 Repository suites pass
<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation Notes

<!-- SECTION:NOTES:BEGIN -->
Implemented skills/delegate-batch/SKILL.md with both entry points, complete OS-temporary work orders, the fixed codex-first runner, work-shape and isolation rules, the 3-5 writing-ticket bound, the completion envelope, steering limits, and unchanged gates. Installer linkage needed no source change: bin/install.sh dynamically discovers skills, prunes removed managed links, and syncs both Codex and Claude. Live delegated run: TASK-39 Change 1 executed from a complete temporary work order in its dedicated feat/delegate-batch worktree. Checks: all seven tests/test-*.sh passed; the BPMN suite reached its existing conformance CLI test but the managed sandbox denied that test's nested Node spawnSync with EPERM, while the same strict CLI invocation run directly produced the expected report and exit 1. Rerun the BPMN suite outside the managed sandbox.
