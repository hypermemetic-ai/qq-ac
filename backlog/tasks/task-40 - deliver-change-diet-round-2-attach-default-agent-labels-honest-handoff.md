## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Per doc-42: slim the delivery choreography that survived Phase 4, using the TASK-35 delivery evidence. Attaching an existing checkout (including harness-created worktrees) becomes the documented default; change labels become agent-chosen and operator-renameable; the handoff verifies the notification result instead of assuming it.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 deliver-change documents attach-existing-checkout as the default path when a checkout already exists, including harness-created worktrees
- [ ] #2 Change labels are agent-chosen and operator-renameable, and the CONCEPTS.md work-session definition matches
- [ ] #3 The handoff step verifies the notification result and, when notifications are disabled, plainly reports the browser-only fallback instead of claiming a notification was sent
- [ ] #4 Repository suites pass
- [ ] #5 Dispatching a headless delegate offers cockpit visibility through a throwaway observability pane in the Change's work session running tail -f --pid=<delegate-pid> on the delegate's stream, so the pane self-retires when the delegate exits; pure glass over the process artifact, no pane-lifecycle ownership
