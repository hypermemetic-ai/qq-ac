# Cockpit

`cockpit/` is the source of truth for the human-driven terminal surface.
Day-0 bootstrap (see the README's Install section) symlinks each config file
into `~/.config`, so editing here or through the live config path edits the
same file; the shell surface is sourced straight from this checkout.

## Files
- `yazi/yazi.toml` — pane-first file navigation; markdown opens in-pane through
  mdcat by default, with tuned Glow as the alternate opener.
- `yazi/keymap.toml` — `Enter` enters folders or opens files, `!` opens a shell
  here, and `g H` jumps to `~/projects/qq`.
- `glow/glow.yml` — fixed-width, no-pager Glow defaults for pane rendering.
- `glow/tuned.json` — the hand-tuned Markdown theme used by Glow.
- `herdr/config.toml` — tokyo-night, onboarding suppressed, priority-sorted
  agent sidebar, sidebar `$stage` token rows for the delegate status surface
  (doc-43), and cockpit popup bindings: `prefix+f` runs `qqy`,
  `prefix+shift+f` runs `qqbr`.
- `shell/file-navigation.bash` — `QQ_HOME`, generic `y()`/`br()` wrappers,
  `qqroot` targeting `QQ_HOME`, space-aware `qqy`/`qqbr`, and `qfiles`/`qtree`
  aliases.

## Flow
Herdr `prefix+f` opens a session-modal popup running `qqy`; `qqy` opens yazi at
the focused space's project folder — the focused Herdr workspace's worktree
checkout. Enter descends into a folder or renders a `.md` file through mdcat or
Glow. `prefix+shift+f` opens broot there through `qqbr`. Both fall back to
`QQ_HOME` when the focused space has no worktree or Herdr is unavailable.
Quitting the browser closes the popup and restores the untouched tiled
layout; yazi's `!` opens a shell in place when one is wanted. The popups use
a fixed 74x29 cell size (operator-tuned) with a matching `stty` preamble
because herdr 0.7.4 draws the popup frame at the configured size but never
sets the popup PTY winsize, and frames wider than the tiled panel clamp.
`prefix+F<N>` pulls the Nth priority-sorted agent into the focused pane;
`prefix+0` pulls the agent that most needs attention. Those operator
bindings use `qq-herdr-pull <N|next>`.

The sidebar carries the delegate status surface's ambient tier: a `$stage` row
on Space and Agent entries renders stage-boundary one-liners reported through
`herdr workspace report-metadata` and `herdr pane report-metadata`
(design: doc-43). The rows collapse when no stage is reported.

Each Repository has one persistent project home bound to its primary `main`
checkout. A dedicated single-pane `backlog board` tab and any operator-created
general tabs stay at that level. Herdr groups each linked-worktree workspace
beneath that home as one work session. Each has a unique, operator-agreed
change label matching `[A-Za-z0-9-]{1,15}`; the label is a recognizable UI
handle, not a branch name or a claim that Tasks and Changes are one-to-one.
Accountable agents validate the home with `qq-herdr-home inspect --repo
<root>`, create or open the worktree from that home workspace with that label,
and dispatch delegated work into it while their own conversation stays in the
project home. `qq-herdr-pull --workspace <workspace-id>` is an
operator-invocable mover, not part of the delivery flow; it fails loudly
unless the target contains exactly one idle shell placeholder.

At terminal Change disposition, the accountable and operator-created work panes
stay intact for inspection and explicit operator retirement, and operator focus
is left untouched. `qq-herdr-home focus-board --repo <root>` is an
operator-invocable validator, not part of the disposition flow: it validates
the persistent home and its unique dedicated Backlog-board tab, then focuses
that tab without moving or closing the work session.
