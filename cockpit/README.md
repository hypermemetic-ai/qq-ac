# Cockpit

`cockpit/` is the source of truth for the human-driven terminal surface.
`bin/install.sh` symlinks each file into `~/.config`, so editing here or through
the live config path edits the same file.

## Files
- `yazi/yazi.toml` — pane-first file navigation; markdown opens in-pane through
  mdcat by default, with tuned Glow as the alternate opener.
- `yazi/keymap.toml` — `Enter` enters folders or opens files, `!` opens a shell
  here, and `g H` jumps to `~/projects/qq`.
- `glow/glow.yml` — fixed-width, no-pager Glow defaults for pane rendering.
- `glow/tuned.json` — the hand-tuned Markdown theme used by Glow.
- `herdr/config.toml` — tokyo-night, onboarding suppressed, priority-sorted
  agent sidebar, and cockpit pane bindings: `prefix+f` runs `qqy`,
  `prefix+shift+f` runs `qqbr`.
- `shell/file-navigation.bash` — `QQ_HOME`, generic `y()`/`br()` wrappers,
  repo-focused `qqroot`/`qqy`/`qqbr`, and `qfiles`/`qtree` aliases.

## Flow
Herdr `prefix+f` spawns a pane running `qqy`; `qqy` opens yazi at the repo root;
Enter descends into a folder or renders a `.md` file in-pane via mdcat or Glow.
`prefix+shift+f` opens broot at the same root through `qqbr`. `prefix+F<N>`
pulls the Nth priority-sorted agent into the focused pane; `prefix+0` pulls the
agent that most needs attention. Those operator bindings use
`qq-herdr-pull <N|next>`.

Each Repository has one persistent project home bound to its primary `main`
checkout. A dedicated single-pane `backlog board` tab and any operator-created
general tabs stay at that level. Herdr groups each linked-worktree workspace
beneath that home as one work session. Each has a unique, operator-agreed
change label matching `[A-Za-z0-9-]{1,15}`; the label is a recognizable UI
handle, not a branch name or a claim that Tasks and Changes are one-to-one.
Accountable agents validate the home with `qq-herdr-home inspect --repo
<root>`, create or open the worktree from that home workspace with that label,
then use `qq-herdr-pull --workspace <workspace-id>` to move the current
conversation into the work session before Repository mutation. That mode fails
loudly unless the target contains exactly one idle shell placeholder.

At terminal Change disposition, the accountable and operator-created work panes
stay intact for inspection and explicit operator retirement. `qq-herdr-home
focus-board --repo <root>` validates the persistent home and its unique dedicated
Backlog-board tab, then focuses that tab without moving or closing the work
session.
