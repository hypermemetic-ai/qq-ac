# The qq methodology

The shared operating core every qq-linked repo runs on. Linked live from the qq
repo via a symlinked `@`-import — do not edit a copy; edit it in qq.

## The layers
- **Rules** — the repo's own `AGENTS.md` header plus this shared import: the
  behavioral floor and how work is routed.
- **Actions** — curated skills, invoked as `/<name>`, linked live from qq's
  `skills/` into `~/.claude/skills/`.
- **Knowledge** — the document stack, four documents with one maintainer each:
  - *Code graph* — **codebase-memory** MCP tools (`search_graph`, `trace_path`,
    `get_architecture`, …): a deterministic structural map, fully derived,
    out-of-repo (`~/.cache`), auto-refreshed. Reach for it when a relational
    question (impact, dependencies, architecture) gets expensive by grep;
    plain file reading is still the default.
  - *Intent + work status* — `backlog/` (Backlog.md): the registry of what the
    operator wants and where work stands, one markdown file per task
    (`backlog task create/edit/list`, `backlog board`). Create tasks in the
    session that owns the main tree and **commit the new task file immediately**
    — IDs are minted from committed branch state, so uncommitted tasks in
    parallel worktrees can mint duplicates. Workers only edit tasks they claim.
    The gate enforces the trust condition: a landing that doesn't touch the
    registry is refused (see Git below).
  - *Durable descriptive docs* — `openwiki/` (OpenWiki): agent-written docs of
    what the system *is*, refreshed inside the gate transaction at landing —
    never pointed at the registry (it would rewrite "want" into "is").
  - *Episodic docs* — `docs/solutions/` + `CONCEPTS.md` via `compound`:
    solved problems and stabilized vocabulary, captured opportunistically.
- **Sessions** — herdr (`herdr`): many named agents in parallel, each isolated in
  its own git worktree; herdr's sidebar shows which agent is blocked / working /
  done / idle, so you see at a glance which one needs you. Agents can also talk
  to each other directly through herdr — `herdr agent list`, `send <target>
  <text>` (follow with `herdr pane send-keys <pane> Enter` to submit), `read
  <target>`, `wait <target> --status idle|working|blocked` — use it when
  coordination helps; there is deliberately no protocol beyond these primitives
  yet.
- **Cockpit** — the operator's tuned terminal surface, linked from the qq repo:
  herdr, yazi, broot, glow, mdcat, shell navigation, and the `qq-phase` status line.
- **Externals** — Context7 (live, version-correct library docs), `gh` (GitHub),
  `fd` / `eza` / `rg` (fast filesystem), and **the gate** (`no-mistakes`, an
  external MIT tool): real work is *pushed to it* — an independent pipeline
  reviews the code, runs the checks, and opens a PR. It implements the
  `blast-radius` / `human` merge gates below — capability you push to, not
  process you maintain.

## Behavioral floor (always)
1. **Think before coding** — surface assumptions, offer interpretations, ask
   before proceeding. Never hide confusion.
2. **Simplicity first** — the minimum that solves the problem; nothing speculative.
3. **Surgical changes** — touch only what you must; preserve the surrounding
   style; clean up only your own mess.
4. **Goal-driven** — define verifiable success criteria, then loop until verified.

## Routing
Triage every task by size and reversibility first. **Triage scales ceremony,
never the landing path** — there is one workflow, and everything lands through
the gate.
- **Trivial + local + reversible** (typo, rename, one-liner): skip Align/Plan —
  just do it, run `verification-before-completion`, commit on green to the
  current working branch. Small changes batch on a branch and land as one
  gated push; they do not commit straight to `main`.
- **Everything else** (multi-file, ambiguous, irreversible): run the loop below,
  starting at Align — or hand the whole task to `orchestrate`, which conducts the
  loop end-to-end (Claude aligns / plans / verifies / reviews; Codex implements).

Two invariants: **`verification-before-completion` is never skipped**, and
**no change reaches `main` except through the gate** — the second is what makes
the intent registry (`backlog/`) trustworthy: one landing path means one
enforcement point.

## The loop
1. **Align** — `grilling` / `grill-me`: resolve intent and open decision branches
   before building.
2. **Plan** — `writing-plans`: turn the agreed intent into an executable,
   step-by-step plan. Work it with `executing-plans`; land it with
   `finishing-a-development-branch` — through the gate (`git push
   no-mistakes <branch>`), like everything else.
3. **Build** — implement per the plan, honoring the floor. Stuck on a bug? →
   `diagnosing-bugs`.
4. **Verify (autonomous)** — `verification-before-completion`: run the real
   command, read the full output, and claim only with evidence.
5. **Sign-off (human, gated)** — `uat-signoff`: for user-facing, irreversible, or
   ambiguous changes, walk the owner through observable tests. Seeded by step 4.
6. **Review** — `code-review` (Standards + Intent) is the *author-side design &
   spec* review; the gate's pipeline is the *independent correctness* review
   (bugs / security / perf) — complementary, not redundant. `receiving-code-review`
   weighs either one's findings instead of rubber-stamping them.
7. **Compound** — `ce-compound`: capture the solved problem to `docs/solutions/`
   and durable vocabulary to `CONCEPTS.md`, so the next session doesn't relearn it.

Support, any time: `research` (delegated, cited investigation → `research/`);
`handoff` (compact state for a fresh agent when context runs low); `writing-skills`
(author or edit a skill, eval-first).

**Progress is stamped.** Long-running work records its current phase to
`.qq/state.json` via `qq-phase <Phase>` at each boundary — cheap, token-free,
per-repo, never an LLM call. The Claude Code status line reads it (`qq-phase
render`, merging the gate's own `no-mistakes axi status` steps), so loop position
and pipeline position show as one. Orchestrate's loop is the first producer; any
background skill can stamp the same surface with free-form phases (e.g.
`capturing`, `researching`) and mark completion with `qq-phase done`.

## Git — how work lands
- **Commit on green.** A commit is a claim: commit only what
  `verification-before-completion` just proved — one commit per verified task or
  batch. History stays bisectable. Un-green WIP never reaches a shared branch.
- **Push the branch after each green commit** — always fast-forward-safe; durability
  plus live visibility for your partner.
- **Undo is `git revert`** to the last green commit — forward and clean, never
  `reset --hard` (the rail blocks it). Commit-on-green is what makes revert cheap.
- **In-flight work is never lost.** A `Stop` hook snapshots the working tree to
  `refs/wip/<branch>` every idle — the un-green counterpart to commit-on-green,
  and non-destructive (never touches HEAD, the index, or `main`). Recover with
  `qq-wip list | diff | branch <name>`.
- **Isolation on demand** — serial work runs in the main tree on a branch; fan out
  parallel agents and each gets its own worktree: `herdr worktree create --branch
  <name>`, then `herdr agent start <name> --cwd <worktree> -- claude`. Isolation *is*
  the coordination model — no file locks. True shared-file work stays serial in the
  main tree, one agent at a time.

**Merge gate: all-gated — one landing path.** Green work accumulates on its
branch; landing is always `git push no-mistakes <branch>` — the independent
pipeline reviews the diff, runs the checks (including the registry check: a
diff that doesn't reconcile `backlog/` is refused), refreshes `openwiki/`
inside the same transaction once configured, and opens a PR a human merges
with one click. The former `trunk` / `blast-radius` modes are retired
(operator decision, 2026-07-07): a second landing path would be a second —
unenforced — registry producer, and partial coverage cannot serve as truth.
Agents never touch `main`.

## Skill index
| skill | reach for it when |
|---|---|
| `orchestrate` | running a non-trivial task through the whole loop end-to-end — Claude conducts, Codex implements |
| `grilling` / `grill-me` | starting non-trivial work — pin down intent first |
| `writing-plans` | turning agreed intent into an executable plan |
| `executing-plans` | working a plan task-by-task (stops on blockers; won't touch main without consent) |
| `finishing-a-development-branch` | landing finished work — the gate does rebase / push / PR, so this narrows to the merge decision |
| `git push no-mistakes` (the gate) | landing work, always — the external pipeline validates the diff and opens a PR; see "Git — how work lands" |
| `verification-before-completion` | before ANY "done / passing / fixed" claim (never skipped) — and the pre-push smoke test before handing a branch to the gate |
| `uat-signoff` | a user-facing / irreversible / ambiguous change needs human acceptance |
| `diagnosing-bugs` | a bug, failing test, or unexpected behavior |
| `code-review` | reviewing a diff — author-side Standards + Intent (design & spec); the gate reviews correctness |
| `receiving-code-review` | weighing review feedback — from `code-review` or the gate (verify, don't obey) |
| `ce-compound` | you just solved something worth not relearning |
| `research` | a task turns into reading legwork |
| `handoff` | the context window is filling — hand off to a fresh agent |
| `writing-skills` | authoring or editing a qq skill (eval-first) |
| `git-guardrails-claude-code` | (safety rail) blocks destructive git — installed as always-on hooks |

Skills are linked from qq, vendored from MIT sources or authored for qq; see qq's
`SKILLS-ATTRIBUTION.md`. The git rail runs as an always-on hook that blocks
force-push, `reset --hard`, `clean -fd`, and history rewrites before they execute.
