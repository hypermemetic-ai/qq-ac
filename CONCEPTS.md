# Concepts

Read this glossary before every work item. These definitions are qq's shared
language; use them consistently in reasoning, conversation, code, Tasks, and
documentation. `compound` keeps the glossary aligned as vocabulary changes.

**Actor** — The operator or a replaceable agent participating in the work. The
operator owns intent and judgment; agents investigate, recommend, execute, and
verify.

**Repository** — The Git history and GitHub project that own the system's files
and delivery state.

**Task** — Backlog.md's durable record of operator intent, acceptance criteria,
dependencies, and work status.

**Change** — A branch, its commits, and its pull request considered as one unit
of delivery.

**Check** — A reproducible observation that provides evidence about a Change,
locally or through GitHub Actions.

**Skill** — A stateless capability invoked when its trigger matches the work.

**Knowledge item** — A durable artifact that preserves system description,
research, an idea, a reusable lesson, or shared vocabulary.

**managed Backlog markdown** — Markdown owned by Backlog and edited only
through the Backlog CLI. When associating documents with a Task, `--doc`
replaces the complete list; it does not append to it.

**GitHub Flow** — The delivery path from branch through pull request and final
Checks to operator merge and automatic branch deletion.

**project home** — A Repository's persistent Herdr workspace bound to its sole
primary `main` checkout. Its dedicated Backlog-board tab and operator-created
general tabs remain at this level; Change work does not.

**work session** — A linked-worktree Herdr workspace natively grouped beneath
its Repository's project home. Its **change label** is an agent-chosen,
operator-renameable recognizer matching `[A-Za-z0-9-]{1,15}`, unique among
sibling work sessions and independent of branch or Task cardinality. One work
session owns one worktree and all tabs, panes, and agents working on its Change
until the operator explicitly retires it.

**green** — A unit of work whose applicable Checks pass with evidence that they
observed the intended subject.

**fresh-context independence** — The review property created when a reviewer
derives findings from the Change and its intent without inheriting the author's
working context or conclusions.

**agent messaging** — Direct coordination between live agents across runtimes
through herdr's list, send, read, and wait operations, plus operator-visible
notifications outside any transcript. It does not start, own, or retire agents.

**work order** — One complete work-order brief per delegated ticket: the
delegate's complete orientation and the plan bound, carrying the ticket and its
acceptance criteria, exact orientation paths and reconciliation facts the owner
already verified, hard constraints, the per-ticket commit protocol, the exact
Checks to run, and the required completion envelope.

**completion envelope** — Every delegate's final message must report per-ticket
status, commits, files changed, Checks run with results, decisions taken that
the operator might contest, open questions, unresolved risks, and the branch
and worktree that contain the work. The owner must verify every claim against
the tree; an envelope claim is not yet evidence.

**silent failure** — A command that succeeds or produces plausible output while
answering a different question from the one intended.

**drift-net** — A deliberately approximate guard that intercepts a well-meaning
Actor's accidental violation of a mandate. It carries a declared threat model
whose out-of-scope finding classes are declined rather than fixed; it is not a
security boundary, and the invariant's exact enforcement lives at the resource
that owns it.

**refuse, don't sanitise** — Reject unsafe or malformed input instead of
rewriting it into a different value and proceeding as though it were valid.

**reproduce before you fix** — Establish an observation that fails on the
unfixed behavior and passes after the fix; a Check that passes in both states
has not verified the repair.
