# Concepts

Durable domain vocabulary for this system. Each entry is a term and its precise,
project-specific meaning. Appended by `ce-compound` as concepts stabilize; read by
agents to speak the same language across sessions.

<!-- entries: `**term** — one-line definition grounded in this codebase.` -->

**background-status surface** — The shared `.qq/state.json` progress file plus
Claude Code status-line reader that lets long-running qq work show ambient phase
and gate progress without transcript chatter.

**qq-phase** — The `bin/qq-phase` command that writes background-work phase state,
renders the one-line status widget, and optionally attaches the active
`no-mistakes` gate run.

**document stack** — The four-document knowledge layer, one maintainer each:
code graph (codebase-memory MCP, derived + out-of-repo) · intent registry
(`backlog/`, gate-enforced) · durable descriptive docs (`openwiki/`,
gate-refreshed) · episodic docs (`docs/solutions/` + `CONCEPTS.md`, compound).

**intent registry** — `backlog/` (Backlog.md): what the operator wants and where
work stands, one markdown file per task. Trustworthy only because it is total —
the gate refuses any landing that doesn't reconcile it
(`bin/qq-registry-check.sh`).

**one landing path** — The all-gated merge rule: every change reaches `main` via
`git push no-mistakes <branch>` → validated PR. Triage scales ceremony, never the
landing path; trivial fixes batch on a branch.
