# Orchestrate rework: Codex workers as first-class herdr panes

_2026-07-08 · design for backlog **task-8** (idea #9). Decided 07-08: Codex is
about to become the main driver, so Codex workers stop being second-class —
they get their own herdr pane, like Claude workers, so there is **one worker
model**. Mechanics smoke-tested 07-08 (scratch workspace): `herdr agent start …
-- codex` is auto-detected as agent `codex` with live idle/working state;
`send` + `pane send-keys Enter` delivers prompts; `wait --status idle` blocks
until the turn ends; herdr captures the codex session id. This plan lands as
its own gated branch **after** `feat/document-stack` merges._

## Goal

Replace orchestrate's headless `codex exec` Build handoffs with a named,
pane-resident Codex worker driven over herdr primitives — visible in the
sidebar, addressable via send/read/wait, isolated per worktree.

## Design

**Worker lifecycle (per orchestrate run):**
1. Start: `herdr agent start cx-<branch> --cwd <tree> --no-focus -- codex`
   (same workspace as the run's tree; `herdr worktree create` first when
   fanning out). One worker per working tree, honoring tree ownership.
2. Trust prompt: after start, `agent read --source visible`; if the directory
   trust prompt is showing, `pane send-keys <pane> Enter` (option 1 is
   preselected). Long-term: pre-trust project roots in `~/.codex/config.toml`.
3. Handoff: write the brief to `.qq/handoffs/<n>-brief.md` (multi-line text
   must not ride `agent send` — a newline submits early). Then
   `agent send cx-<branch> "Execute .qq/handoffs/<n>-brief.md; when done write
   .qq/handoffs/<n>-report.md (what changed, files touched, how to verify)."`
   followed by `pane send-keys <pane> Enter`.
4. Wait: `herdr agent wait cx-<branch> --status idle --timeout <generous>`;
   on timeout, `agent read` for signs of life before declaring it stuck. A
   worker parked on an approval prompt surfaces as blocked → read the pane,
   answer or escalate to the owner.
5. Report-back is **file-based**: the conductor reads
   `.qq/handoffs/<n>-report.md`. Scrollback (`agent read`) is debug/fallback
   only — never parse it as the result of record.
6. Repair loop: the pane session is alive — send the failing evidence as a
   follow-up message in the same pane. `codex exec resume --last` semantics
   (and its cross-worktree bleed hazard, audit Part 2.3) are deleted, not
   scoped. If a pane dies, herdr holds the codex session id
   (`agent get` → `agent_session.value`) for an explicit resume.
7. Teardown: on run completion the worker pane stays for the operator to
   inspect; `qq-phase done` marks the run. Closing panes is the operator's
   call (or `herdr pane close` when the workspace was created by the run).

**What this deletes:** the `< /dev/null` stdin-hang rule (ideas/03) — panes
are interactive; there is no headless path left in orchestrate.

**Comms:** this is the first real consumer of the herdr agent-comms
primitives (idea #8, methodology § Sessions) — conductor↔worker messaging
uses them unmodified; still no protocol beyond the handoff-file convention.

## Tasks

1. **Rewrite `skills/orchestrate/SKILL.md` § Who-does-what + § 3 Build** to the
   worker-pane lifecycle above; update § 4 Verify's repair handoff (same pane,
   no resume); drop the stdin-hang section; align step 0 wording with the
   all-gated routing (batch on branch — never straight to `main`).
   *Accept:* no `codex exec` invocation remains in the skill; the lifecycle
   steps 1–7 are each present and unambiguous.
2. **Add `.qq/handoffs/` convention** to the skill (gitignored via `.qq/`).
   *Accept:* brief + report naming (`<n>-brief.md` / `<n>-report.md`) stated
   once, referenced everywhere else.
3. **Retire ideas/03** (stdin hang) — mark superseded by this branch in
   `ideas/README.md`; update task-3's codex-resume item in `backlog/`.
   *Accept:* records point here; no live doc still teaches `resume --last`.
4. **End-to-end verification** — run a real (small) orchestrate task through
   the new Build path in a worktree: start worker, two handoffs (one clean,
   one deliberate red→repair), file reports read back, land through the gate.
   *Accept:* evidence bundle in the run transcript; `verification-before-
   completion` green; task-8 ACs checked off in `backlog/`.

## Risks / open

- `agent send` newline handling: long briefs must go via file (designed in).
- Non-focused pane rendering: worked in the smoke test; re-verify under a
  real multi-hour build.
- `wait --status idle` fidelity during codex sub-shell activity: if idle
  flickers mid-turn, add a settle re-check (wait idle twice, N s apart).
- Codex resume-by-id flag name for dead panes: confirm during build.
